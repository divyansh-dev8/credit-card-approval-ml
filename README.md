⚠️ Disclaimer
This application is built for educational purposes only.
It does not represent real banking or financial decisions.

This version reads naturally, like something a developer would write for GitHub or a portfolio.
👉 Do you want me to also add a sample screenshot section (with placeholders) so your README looks visually complete, even before you upload images?
